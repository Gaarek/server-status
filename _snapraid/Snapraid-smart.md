The FP column is the estimated probability (in percentage) that the disk
is going to fail in the next year.

Probability that at least one disk is going to fail in the next year is 100%.

Probability of data loss in the next year for different parity and
combined scrub and repair time:

These values are the probabilities that in the next year you'll have a
sequence of failures that the parity WONT be able to recover, assuming
that you regularly scrub, and in case repair, the array in the specified
time.
